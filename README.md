# Vampire Shifters

This game was made as (obviously) vampire survivors in mind (very nice game) as a submission for [CENG462 Fall 2025](https://itch.io/jam/ceng462-fall-2025) game jam. 

We wanted to combine the addictive gameplay of vampire survivors into multiplayer and fun-with-friends nature of games; with PVP, PVE and single player features in mind. 

The game is mostly vibe-coded, and uses Unity Relay and Lobby features for networking, i think it could be a fun little game for exploring.

Vampire Shifters was made with scaling in mind so scriptable objects and lots of parameters for balancing.
